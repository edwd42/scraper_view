          <h1>CareerDevs Capstone Scraper Project</h1>
          <p>
            <span style={spanStyle}>Main Task </span>Build a Java scraper that
            will pull stock data from your personal Yahoo finance account. This
            application should store each scrape in a database so as to be able
            to retain a history of past scraped data. This scraper will include
            a web-based user facing interface, which pulls data from a RESTAPI
            as JSON data, where the user will be able to view the historic data,
            request a new scrape, and see the most recent scraped data as well.
          </p>

          <p>
            Following the MVC pattern (Model-View-Controller) I built this app
            using Java and Spring Boot for the controller, ReactJS for the view
            and MongoDB on the back-end. The diagram below depicts controller
            and database layers.
          </p>
          <p>
            I chose to write the view in ReactJS because it is fast, lightweight
            and portable.
